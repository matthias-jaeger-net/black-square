# black-square
An assembly language program recreating Kazimir Malevich's Black Square with a pixel image

# What is this?
Started as a joke, now becoming reality and I attemt to render an image in the assembly languge. I know nothing about assembly but see this as a coding challenge where I build upon resouces from the web, that I document here

# First steps
``shell brew install nasm``

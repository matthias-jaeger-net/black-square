# black-square
An assembly language program recreating Kazimir Malevich's Black Square with a pixel image

# What is this?
Started as a joke, now becoming reality and I attemt to render an image in the assembly languge. I know nothing about assembly but see this as a coding challenge where I build upon resouces from the web, that I document here

# First steps
I am working on MacOSX so my choice fell on using nasm (https://www.nasm.us/) as my assembler ``brew install nasm``. After that  I went to the terminal and created a folder with a ``hello.asm``file in it.
